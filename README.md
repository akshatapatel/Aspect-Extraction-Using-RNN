# Aspect-Extraction-Using-RNN
Used Recurrent Neural Network to extract the aspect of textual restaurant reviews

o	Analyzed restaurant reviews from the SemEval 2014-Task 4 data set and created normalized vectors from words using the word2vec function from the gensim library.

o	Implemented a Recurrent Neural Network with the word vector input for aspect extraction in TensorFlow to predict output aspect vectors.

Run:

1) Run the word2vec.ipynb file to create the word vectors and create the word2vec.csv

2) Run the AspectExtraction_Using_RNN.ipynb to train the RNN network and estimate the loss.
